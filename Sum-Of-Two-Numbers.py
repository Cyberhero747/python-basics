# using 'int' for numbers.
A = int (input ("Enter your Fisrt No: "))      # We have printed 'Enter your first number:' and also used the input function, saving its result in a variable named 'A'.
B = int (input ("Enter your Second No: "))
print ("Total sum is: " , A + B)
# Similarly, we can use '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, and '/' for division.
